# ISO-TP protocols (e.g. UDS, KWP)
The original protocol supported by the Lua Simulation Format is ISO-TP.

The header contains the following fields:

* `RequestId` â€“ CAN ID for frames directed to the simulated ECU
* `ResponseId` - CAN ID for frames directed from the simulated ECU to the tester
* `BroadcastId` - CAN ID for functional request frames

Currently 11bit and 29bit CAN-IDs can be specified. Extended addressing is not yet defined.

Request/Response pairs are defined in a section called "Raw".

## Example

```lua
PCM = {
    RequestId = 0x100,
    ResponseId = 0x200,
    BroadcastId = 0x300,

    Raw = {
        ["10 02"] = "50 02 00 19 01 F4",
        ["22 FA BC"] = "62 FA BC 10 33 11",
    }
}
```
