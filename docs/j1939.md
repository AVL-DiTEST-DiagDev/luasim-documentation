# J1939
Currently it is possible to define J1939 PGNs sent cyclic or on request.

The header contains the address of the ECU. The name of the field (J1939SourceAddress) is derived from the ISO ComParam CP_J1939SourceAddress.

```lua
MyJ1939ECU = {
   J1939SourceAddress = 0x03,
}
```

All PGNs are defined in a sub-table called "PGNs".
A PGN is defined in reverse order hex. This in the same way it is used via the D-PDU-API (ISO 22900-2).

In particular that means:
* PGN 65226
* in hex -> 0x00FECA
* reverse definition like ISO22900-2 in lua
```lua
["CA FE 00"]
```

There are two possible ways to define the response paload.
* directly as mapping from PGN to payload
```lua
      ["CA FE 00"] = "FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF",
```

* as a property named "payload"
```lua
      ["CA FE 00"] = { 
         payload = "FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF",
      },
```

In the second case it is also possible to specify a cycle time for periodic sending.
```lua
      ["CA FE 00"] = { 
         payload = "FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF",
         cycleTime = 50
      },
```

In all cases the payload can be defined as a lua function.

## Example

```lua
MyJ1939ECU = {
   J1939SourceAddress = 0x03,

   PGNs = {
      -- direct mapping of PGN to payload 
      ["CA FE 00"] = "FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF",
      ["CB FE 00"] = function()
        return "FF " .. ascii("Foo")
      end,

      -- using the "payload" property with optional cycleTime
      ["CC FE 00"] = { 
         payload = "FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF",
      },
      ["CD FE 00"] = { 
         payload = function()
            return "FF " .. ascii("Foo")
         end,
         cycleTime = 50
      },
   }
}
```
